# 🏨 Hostel Management System - Java Project

A Java-based **Hostel Management System** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and a user-friendly **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. This project aims to manage hostel-related operations such as student registration, room allocation, fee status, and more.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The primary goal of this project is to:
- Apply core **OOP concepts** in a real-world application.
- Build a functional **GUI** using Java's Swing/AWT framework.
- Manage hostel operations efficiently through a structured codebase.

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Java (JDK 8 or higher)**
- **Java Swing** for GUI
- **File Handling** or **JDBC** for data persistence *(based on implementation)*
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / NetBeans

## 🧱 OOP Concepts Applied

- **Encapsulation**: Secure student and room data through private fields and getters/setters.
- **Abstraction**: Modular design using interfaces or abstract classes (if applicable).
- **Inheritance**: Base classes for common entities like `Person` or `Room`.
- **Polymorphism**: Overloaded methods for flexible record handling.

The GUI is designed with **Java Swing**, featuring:
- Menus & Buttons
- Forms for data entry
- Tables for record display
- Dialog boxes for notifications and confirmations
